<p>IT238 Final Project Summary

<br>
<br>
     For this project, we decided to take the archeology game board and up it up a notch.
	 We wanted to add a drag and drop feature to the game. To do this,<br>
	 we added a image of a shovel and gave it the ability to have an actionable drag and drop feature to make it
	 seem you're really digging up spots looking for these artifacts.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
	 	What the project does:
<br>
<br>		
-	This final project builds upon the original assignment 4 for this class.
<br>
<br> 
-	We implemented a drag on drop feature that was previously talked about in class, but not used in any of the assignments
<br>
<br>
-	Instead of the user clicking on a square on the grid to search for an artifact, we removed that ability and made it where the only way to reveal a square, is to drag and drop the shovel over the desired location.
<br>
<br>
-	We have a table indicating how many of each artifact is left to be found with corresponding images for easy readability. There will also be message showing when you have found a piece or found the entirety of an artifact.
<br>
<br>
-	Once the game is completed, an alert will pop up letting you know so. It will also give you a rating on how you did. Excellent, good, or terrible.
<br>
<br>
-	We also added a header menu that doesn’t link to anything really, other than the summary page under the “about the project” list. We just wanted to show that we could make this possible.
<br>
<br>
-	We also added hard mode that makes the board 14x14. You can change the difficulty back and forth whenever you please. It will reset the board and score upon changing difficulties.
<br>
<br>
-	We had a little fun with the CSS and tried experimenting with different texts and effects very briefly. We stuck with a glow effect for the dig/artifact counter above the game board.
<br>

Group Work:
<br>
<br>
-	To work on this project, we opened up a shared terminal on cloud9 at: https://ide.c9.io/jszul/it238finalprojet
<br>
<br>
-	We communicated on Google hangouts to talk to each other while working on the project.
<br>
<br>
-	To make sure we contributed an equal amount, we worked on the project 95% of the time only when we were both online to talk to each other and run ideas by one another to make sure we had as little confusion as possible.
<br>
<br>
-	We shared an equal amount of work within the creation of this project between the ideas that we wanted to do for the project, coding, creating this document, and doing outside research to make things work.
